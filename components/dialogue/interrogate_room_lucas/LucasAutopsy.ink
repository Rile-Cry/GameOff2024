This autopsy report shows Evelyn was on sleeping pills prior to her death.
Was Evelyn on any medication prior to her death? Or did she talk about any sleeping issues?

That's strange I Don't think so, Evelyn had sleep problems but she never took any medication. In fact, she was against it. #exclaim
